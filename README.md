# SpawnElytra

Configurable plugin that allows players to activate elytra flying within a certain radius of the spawn. In addition, it allows you to use a pre-set boost.
You can setup this plugin in the config.yml file.

**config.yml:**
- **useRadius: 25** => *sets the radius at the spawn in which players can use the elytra to fly*
- **multiplyValue: 2** => *sets the multiplier of the flying players' boost*
- **world: world** => *the world in which flying elytra should be available at spawn*
